# karydia - Kubernetes security walnut

![karydia Logo](logo/Karydia@0.5x.png)

Status: alpha, work in progress

karydia is a security add-on to Kubernetes to help with good security practices
and assist administrators in keeping their clusters safe. karydia is implemented as
[webhook admission
controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/)
and configurable through its command line interface and Kubernetes resources.

While it has been written with [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) in mind, it
can be used on any Kubernetes cluster.
